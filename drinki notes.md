# Drinki Q&A notes

## General

How do you update the hours available?
Bars or admins can do this, they have access to the same part of the server to edit this. 

## Admins

* Admins can change user details.
* Bars opening hours from google places
* Admins talk to bartenders to discuss suitability of offer times.
* Occasionally admin will decide to have specific offers driven by drinks companies, otherwise it is up to the bar.

## Bartenders

* Bartenders can choose their drink, crete new drinks and offers. 

## General

* Under 24s may not have access to all bars, they are hidden completely.

* When using a code, after the app refresh the notifiction of code accepted should show.

* The ioS app and Android app will not mirror due to different funcitonlities.  Would like to mirror features but adapt to user interface.

* They tie the app to a device, so a user's account cannot be used on other devices that has a dirnki account.

* Drinki tokens should not expire unless used. 

* Session run: however long your're on the app plus 10mins.

* The number of people that refer other people: 40% acquistion occurs through sharing/referring.

# Known Issues:

* Losing Drinkis without using them. Could give access to appium from Drinki.

# Priorities:

* Core UJS: Sign up, Log in, venues show and are ordered correctly (closer ones (800m/10mins walk and available) at the top of the page, then sorted by distance, seamlessly get the redeem scheme, get the drink.
* Referrals, correct drinkis applied when referring.
* Add defects to Trello.
